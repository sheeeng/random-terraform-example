## Template rules files

You can use the GitHub Super-Linter _with_ or _without_ your own personal rules sets. This allows for greater flexibility for each individual codebase. The Template rules all try to follow the standards we believe should be enabled at the basic level.

Copy any or all template rules files from [TEMPLATES directory](https://github.com/github/super-linter/tree/master/TEMPLATES) into your repository in the location: `.github/linters/` of your repository.

If your repository does not have rules files, they will fall back to defaults in the repository's [TEMPLATE directory](https://github.com/github/super-linter/tree/master/TEMPLATES).
